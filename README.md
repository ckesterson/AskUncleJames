A Magic Eight Ball for the Art Market Starring James Christie

Ask Uncle James' image is based on the art auctioneer James Christie's, founder of the auction house Christie's, where I used to work. His original portrait is by Thomas Gainsborough [https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/103RAG] and I recreated his image here using GIMP.
